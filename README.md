# cosmoteermod-fusion
A mod for cosmoteer that adds fusion reactors, and maybe some other stuff!

cosmoteermod-fusion:

  Initial goals:
    > new reactor type that:
      - has a different color (thinking blue/purple)
      - maybe has faster energy gen, or is more compact than fission reactors

  Eventual goals:
    > uses new/different resources in its procurement
    > is unlocked via a tech tree
    > maybe is more powerful than fission, but requires tritium/deuterium from the sun?
    > if I can make a "nuclear engines" mod, then maybe add support for fusion powered engines as well?
    > maybe add different types of fusion reactors? Modular types?
